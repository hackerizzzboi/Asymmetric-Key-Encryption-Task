1. Create a directory "LAB2" on your home directory
2. Inside "LAB2" create SIX sub-directories "PLAIN" "ENC" "DEC" "KEYS" "SIGN" and "HASH"
3. Inside "PLAIN", create a file "plain.txt"
4. Edit some meaningful lines of text in "plain.txt".

5. Generate private key and public key inside "KEYS" sub-directory

(SAVE all the encrypted files on "ENC" sub-directory and signature in "SIGN" sub-directory) (THREE files will be created)

6. Encrypt the "plain" file using public key as "enc_public_data"
7. Encrypt the "plain" file using private key as "enc_private_data"
8. Sign the "plain" file using private key as "sign_private_data"

(SAVE all the decrypted files on "DEC" sub-directory)

9. Decrypt each encrypted files using their required keys and generate THREE separate files
   dec_public_private.txt, dec_private_private.txt and dec_private_public.txt respectively.

(SAVE all the calculated hash files on "HASH" sub-directory)

10. Calculate the Hash values of "plain.txt" and any encrypted file using MD5, SHA-1 and rmd160
 ( SIX files will be created)

11. What difference do you notice in each of the encrypted files?
12. Are the decrypted files same or different?
13. Can you generate the plain text from "enc_private_data" using public key?
14. Hash value of file "enc_public_data" using MD5 algorithm and SHA-1 algorithm is same or different?
